            I was never the best at school or academics, Iâ€™m just a super
            curious guy and like solve problem especially in software. I'd say
            the journey was better than the destination when solved problem.
            Sometimes people don't get to their destination. But their journey
            teaches them to go other places, even though they might not of
            gotten to their goal and I have worked on several projects.
